  <div class="lead">
    <p>I'm a currently a <a href="http://cs.uwaterloo.ca">Computer Science</a> student at the <a href="http://uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a>, located in Ontario, Canada. I have a strong passion for what I study, and love solving problems using what I've learned! Among my learning is prospective studies in machine learning, language theory.</p>  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I guess this will just become a bit of a ramble about myself, but either way.
I'm huge self-driven learner. If there is anything that interests me at all, I will likely just chug on and take in all I can about the topic, and give a bunch of shots to implementing or doing whatever it is. This is primarily what has led me to my position and passion for computer science.</p>
<p>At first I always found myself as the type who just wanted to know how the world works. A major part of that is how computers worked. Having grown up in an environment where I was more or less just dropped into the position of using a computer, I had to discover on my own how to make use of it. From this I found a keen interest in an understanding of how programs worked, and before I really got into program development I dipped into reverse engineering.</p>
<p>With the desire of reverse engineering, I had gained a stronger understanding of how <em>other's</em> programs worked. Although I have come to a much further point than when I had initially stumbled upon reverse engineering, I still find the joy of in general discovering how applications may operating on the lower level - for example how the assembly code executes for a given application. Throughout my uses of reverse engineering though I have discovered a strong importance of security and have learned where precautions should be taken and also where vulnerabilities often lay in specific platforms (Flash and Java have been the ones I have really dedicated time and have learned in regards to program integrity in regards to modification attempts or hooks and the like).</p>
<p>Continuing, I also found myself with a desire of how the hardware itself works. Knowing the whole spectrum of computers I found has led me to a very comprehensive understanding of all levels of the system, and I've found that knowing both the absolute hardware end and the absolute software end has been a satisfying piece of knowledge for learning about general levels of abstraction in any system. I often took it up to dive into various hardware projects and I have devoted a large amount of time reading documentation on various platforms, one of my primary goals from doing so was to implement a emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System. This goal has definitely brought me to my appreciation of what hardware can do, and for such a system to be so comprehensive also through small hacks that were done to accomplish large intensive goals on hardware which isn't as powerful as desired.</p>
<p>Lately I have been gaining an interest for server based applications, and the idea of handling large amounts of data at scale is something I feel as though I would enjoy. Currently I'm attempting to make a number of projects based around the idea of handling data as so, scaling for multiple users and handling data as so. While creating and designing these server systems though also brings need to an interface to provide this data to the users in a friendly user experience! I'm also driving towards a keen understanding of user to computer interactions and hoping to be able to implement web systems like so.</p>  </div>
