Hi there! Currently, if you're wondering. I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, located in Ontario, Canada. I have a strong passion for what I study, and love solving problems using what I've learned! Among my learning is prospective studies in machine learning, language theory, hardware architecture, and more!
