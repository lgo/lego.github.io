jjNES is a project driven by my passion to learn. It's primary goal is not for the project itself but for what I hope to get out of the project. While there is not much to show in terms of functional code, I have created a model of how the architecture that the Nintendo Entertainment System is built upon operates. What I hoped to get out of it was a deeper understanding of how computer architectures in general operate and without a doubt I have gained knowledge outside of what I had expected to throughout my research of the NES architecture system. Such things are the purpose and mapping of assembly to machine code, the interpretation of machine code, and various important components that create the underlying system such as a uniform clock frequency.

Much of the project to this point has been spent reading documents on the architecture components and interactions such as the NES's 6502 CPU.
