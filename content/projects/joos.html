As a commonly trending interest of mine, I love to fall into depths of documentation and outlining of how computers on the underside operate. That leads me to a bit of a higher level discovery then my previous NES project, but still a relatively low level - involving a deeper understanding of registers, memory management, cpu cycles in regards to individual instructions, and more.

My target for this project is grab hold of concepts more so and be able to incorporate them successfully into the project and possibly move the operating system into usability [or more so proof of concept for features]. Currently the feature and/or concept with the most effort being put in is interrupt handling, which leads to input and various other tasks the CPU has to undergo during execution where it passes information to the operating system.
